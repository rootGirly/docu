# Configuring Privileged Identity Management


Privileged Identity Management (PIM) is a Microsoft Entra ID service that enables just-in-time (JIT) privileged access to Azure and Microsoft Entra roles. Instead of granting permanent admin access — which creates a persistent attack surface. PIM requires users to request and activate elevated access for a limited time window, with optional approval and justification requirements.

In this lab, I will configure PIM for the **Conditional Access Administrator** role, enforce an approval-based activation workflow, validate that elevated access works as expected, and then enable a system-assigned managed identity on an Azure App Service.

Exercise:

* Assign the Conditional Access Administrator role as a PIM-eligible role assignment
* Configure activation settings including a time limit, justification requirement, and approver
* Request and approve a role activation using two separate accounts
* Verify that the activated role grants the expected access
* Enable a system-assigned managed identity on a pre-provisioned App Service
* Deactivate the role to close the just-in-time access window

>This exercise should take approximately 45 minutes to complete.


## Assign a PIM-eligible role

In this section, I assign the Conditional Access Administrator role to **Adele Vance** as an eligible assignment. An eligible assignment means the user does not hold the role permanently they must request and activate it each time they need it.

1. Sign in to the Microsoft Entra admin center at [https://entra.microsoft.com](https://entra.microsoft.com) using the Administrator credentials.
1. In the left navigation, expand **ID Governance** and select **Privileged Identity Management**.
1. Under **Manage**, select **Microsoft Entra roles**.
1. Select **Assignments**, then select **Add assignments**.
1. On the **+ Add assignments** page, configure the following:

	| Setting | Value |
	|---------|-------|
	| **Select role** | Conditional Access Administrator|
	| **Select members** | Adele Vance |
	| **Assignment type** | Eligible (after using the Next button) |

1. Select **Next**, then select **Assign** to save the assignment.

1. On the **Assignments** page, confirm that **Adele Vance** appears under the **Eligible assignments** tab with the role **Conditional Access Administrator**.

    > **Note**: An eligible assignment does not grant access — it only enables the user to request activation. No access is active at this point.

## Configure activation settings

PIM role settings control how the activation process works: how long the activation lasts, whether a justification is required, and whether an approver must approve each request. You will now configure the Conditional Access Administrator role settings.

1. In **Privileged Identity Management > Microsoft Entra roles**, select **Settings**.

1. Find and select **Conditional Access Administrator** from the role list.

1. Select **Edit** to open the role settings.

1. On the **Activation** tab, configure the following settings:

    | Setting | Value |
    |---------|-------|
    | **Activation maximum duration** | 1 hour |
    | **On activation, require** | Justification |
    | **Require approval to activate** | Enabled |
    | **Other settings** | Leave at default value |

1. Under **Select approvers**, select **+ Select members**.

1. Search for and select **MOD Administrator**, then choose **Select**.

1. Select **Update** to save the role settings.

1. Verify the role settings page now shows:
    - Maximum activation duration: **1 hour**
    - Approval required: **Yes**
    - Approver: **administrator**

## Request role activation

Now you will sign in as **Adele Vance** and submit a role activation request. This simulates a user who needs temporary elevated access to perform a specific task.

1. Open a new **InPrivate** or **Private** browser window.

1. Navigate to the Entra Admin Center using `https://entra.microsoft.com` and sign in as **Adele Vance** using the credentials from the **Resources** tab.

2. In the left navigation, expand **Identity governance** and select **Privileged Identity Management**.

3. Under **Tasks**, select **My roles**.

4. Select the **Microsoft Entra roles** tab.

5. Under **Eligible assignments**, find **Conditional Access Administrator** and select **Activate**.

6. On the **Activate** pane, configure the following:

    | Setting | Value |
    |---------|-------|
    | **Duration** | 1 hour |
    | **Justification** | `Reviewing and updating Conditional Access policies as part of a scheduled security review.` |

7. Select **Activate**.

    You will see a confirmation that the request is pending approval. The role is not yet active — it requires approval from **Administrator** before access is granted.

8. Leave this browser window open — you will return to it after approving the request.

---

## Approve the activation request

You will now switch to the **Administrator** account and approve the pending activation request.

1. Return to your primary browser window (MOD Administrator is current logged in).

1. Navigate to the Microsoft Entra Admin Center.

1. In the left navigation, expand **Identity governance** and select **Privileged Identity Management**.

1. Under **Tasks**, select **Approve requests**.

1. Select the **Microsoft Entra roles** menu item.

1. Find the pending request from **Adele Vance** for the **Conditional Access Administrator** role.

1. Add a mark in the box next to the request, then select **Approve**.

1. In the **Justification** field, enter: `Approved for scheduled security review task.`
    ```

1. Select **Submit**.

    You should see an approval message pop-up.

1. You can now minimize this browser window.

---

## Verify the activated role

Return to the **Adele Vance** browser window and verify that the role activation succeeded and grants the expected access.

1. In the **Adele Vance** browser window, refresh the page.

1. In **Privileged Identity Management > My roles > Microsoft Entra roles**, select the **Active assignments** tab.

1. Confirm that **Conditional Access Administrator** appears with a status of **Active** and an expiration time approximately 1 hour from now.

## Test the activation in Conditional Access

1. Look at the menu on the left.

1. In the left navigation, find the **Entra ID** section and select **Conditional Access**.

1. Select **+ Create New policy** to open the policy creation pane.

    > **Note**: If you can open the new policy pane, the role is active and granting the expected permissions. A user without this role would see an error or the option would be unavailable.

1. Select **X** to close the policy pane without saving — creating a policy is not required for this verification step.

---

## Deactivate the role

Just-in-time access means access should be released as soon as the task is complete — not held until the time window expires. You will now manually deactivate the Conditional Access Administrator role for **sAdele Vance**.

1. Return to the **Administrator** browser window.

1. Navigate to **Privileged Identity Management > My roles > Microsoft Entra roles > Active assignments**.

1. Find the **Conditional Access Administrator** assignment and select **Deactivate**.

1. In the confirmation dialog, select **Deactivate** again.

1. Confirm the role no longer appears under **Active assignments** and has returned to **Eligible assignments** only.

    The access window is now closed. If sc500-user01 needs to perform CA Admin tasks again, they must submit a new activation request.
